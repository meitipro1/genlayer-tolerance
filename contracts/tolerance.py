Tolerance — numeric extraction with declared per-field tolerances
================================================================

WHAT IT IS
    A reusable primitive for pulling several numbers out of a web page, where
    each number declares ON CHAIN how closely validators must agree about it.

THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
    This is the single most common mistake in Intelligent Contracts. Somebody
    reads a number off a page and wraps it in strict_eq. It works in Studio with
    one validator and then never reaches consensus on a real network, because
    two nodes fetch the page four seconds apart and one of them sees 1,204 and
    the other sees 1,205.

    The reflex fix is to loosen everything to a prompt-based principle, which
    then also accepts 12,040. Both failures come from the same mistake: applying
    ONE agreement rule to numbers that have completely different stability.
    A published fee percentage should match exactly. A live counter should not.

HOW CONSENSUS IS USED  (this is the interesting part)
    Every field carries its own tolerance mode, chosen when the reading was
    defined and frozen there:

        exact       identical to within floating point noise
        abs:X       may differ by at most X in absolute terms
        pct:X       may differ by at most X percent of the larger value
        band:a,b,c  must fall in the same declared bucket

    The block returns one value per field. The validator runs its own read and
    then compares FIELD BY FIELD, each against its own rule. Agreement means
    every field passed its own test. One volatile field does not get to loosen
    the rule for a stable one, and one stable field does not get to break
    consensus over a volatile one.

    band is the strongest of the four and the one most people should reach for.
    It collapses a noisy number to a bucket before consensus ever sees it, which
    is the general trick for making any noisy output agreeable.

    There is a second, deterministic gate after consensus: each field may
    declare max_step, the largest change accepted from the previous stored
    reading. A value that passes validator agreement but jumps ten thousandfold
    from yesterday is rejected as implausible rather than stored. Validators
    agreeing that they both read the same absurd number does not make it true.

WHY IT IS NOT A THIN LLM WRAPPER
    The model extracts; it never decides. Which numbers are acceptable, how far
    apart two nodes may be, and how far a value may move between readings are
    all declared on chain before any model runs, and all enforced in Python.

REUSE
    Any price, count, rate, limit, threshold or percentage that a contract
    currently reads from a page belongs in one of these four modes. The
    comparison function is pure and copyable on its own.
